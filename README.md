# VARA COLORS

VARA Colors is a project made during [Polkadot Prodigy Hackaton.](https://www.polkadotprodigy.com/)
It's a collection of non-fungible tokens living entirely on the VARA blockchain. Contrary to regular NFTs, there is no metadata off-chain as all their attributes are living on the blockchain, in the program's state.

NFT from Vara Colors don't need a server to be displayed. They question what an image *is* and what defines the *uniqueness* of a token.

The idea behind this project was to experiment with the [VARA blockchain](https://vara.network/developers), which enables smart-contracts to be created in Rust. Thanks to its technology, each NFT is unique and permanent.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** Vue, Nuxt, TailwindCSS

**Server:** Node, Vercel

**Blockchain:** Gear-js, Vara staging network

## Roadmap

- Create the proof-of-concept âœ…

- Fix the problem with webpack, Nuxt and gear-api on Vercel

- Deploy contract on VARA Network (main-net)

- Add a gallery of Vara Colors already mined

- Transform the collection into a DAO: the VARA collected will go to secure the chain, and the rewards will be passed on to the NFT holders, in proportion to those they own.

## Optimizations

Unfortunately, there seems to be a problem between Vercel, gear-api, Nuxt and webpack that is hindering deployment. Although the code works locally, the deployed front-end doesn't allow the transaction to be launched. However, the code is available as a comment on github and works locally.
